AUTHOR:     Maxim Vuets - an enthusiast and rationalizer
DURATION:   50 min
ABSTRACT:   I had a problem: got two somewhat-structured music playlists
            that were overlapping. And I wanted to merge them together.
            In this talk I explain what fuzzy text matching is;
            cover a couple of techniques to do it; and showcase how
            Text::Fuzzy helped me to solve the problem. Colored terminal
            examples included.
