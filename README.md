I had a problem: got two somewhat-structured music playlists
that were overlapping. And I wanted to merge them together.
In this talk I explain what fuzzy text matching is;
cover a couple of techniques to do it; and showcase how
Text::Fuzzy helped me to solve the problem. Colored terminal
examples included.
