-   hi. this is talk... my name... thanks...

020.about.jpg

-   ...

030.agenda.jpg

-   idea of the talk
-   demo
-   algorithms

040.background.jpg

-   like music, listen online
-   ♥ some songs, result - playlist scattered
-   last.fm - tsv
-   messy plain text files
-   overlaps, duplicates
-   want - single canonical list
-   problem: misspelled, different formats, non-structured.

050.seek-and-destroy.jpg

-   find & remove duplicates
-   wrote a qirty script on a saturday morning
-   amsterdamx.pm: 10 min talk?
-   Stevan & Upasana: maybe 20 min?
-   here i am

-   artist & song swapped
-   cyrillic vs. latin
-   typos
-   punctuation marks
-   letter case
-   minor (alternative song names)

130.ex8.jpg

-   worst case, want it to be spotted automatically
-   live demo
-   ~100 dups removed
-   what's fuzzy text matching?
-   algs and techniques to find strings that match approximately

140.typoglycemia.jpg

-   it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only
    important thing is that the first and last letter be in the right
    place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it
    without a problem.

150.on-intelligence.png

-   by Jeff Hawkins
-   human brains are great at pattern matching

160.applications.jpg

—   spell checker
—   plagiarism detection
—   bioinformatics: can be used to quantify the similarity of
    macromolecules such as DNA, which can be viewed as strings of the
    letters A, C, G and T.
—   audio and image pattern recognition

170.defenetly.png

-   https://www.google.com/search?q=defenetly
-   good spell checking

180.perv.png

-   https://twitter.com/mvuets/status/619422257753030656
-   bad spell checking

210.word-ladder.jpg

-   word ladder aka doublets - brain teaser
-   changing one letter at a time, genuine words
-   from hand to foot

215.ed-illustrated.jpg

-   similar to word ladder
-   set of primitive operations:
    insert, delete, substitute, transpose
-   output: metric that denotes nr. of operations
-   a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings are to one another
    by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform
    one string into the other

220.grid1.jpg
230.grid2.jpg
240.grid3.jpg
250.grid4.jpg
260.grid5.jpg

-   move left to right, top to bottom
-   take the minimum number from 3 adjecent cells;
    add +1 if letters on the intersection mismatch
-   resulting bottom right number is the edit distance

270.horse-roses.jpg

-   illustration of three types of opearations:
    substitution, deletion, and insertion

280.ed-algs.jpg

-   most popular algorithm - levenshtein distance
-   LCS - used in diff(1)
-   others: differ in set of allowed operations
    and their cost

290.text-fuzzy.jpg

-   Text::Fuzzy - partial or fuzzy string matching using edit distances

300.bitap.jpg

-   online alg - no index and pre-processing
-   only pattern is processed

310.agrep-code.png

-   fuzzy grep

320.bitap-code.png
330.re-engine-tre.jpg

-   fuzzy regex

340.cos-sim.jpg

-   matches long texts rather than short strings
-   is a measure of similarity between two vectors

350.cos.jpg

-   vectors match - cos is 1
-   as vectors diverge - cos converges to 0
-   cosine similarity between two texts - similar idea

360.vector.jpg

-   vectors represent text in terms of features
-   feature - measurable property

370.ngram.jpg

-   n-gram - simple and widely used feature
-   n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items
    from a given sequence of text
-   slicing a text into chunks of length n using a moving window
-   n=1 - unigram
    n=2 - bigram
    n=3 - trigram

380.anagram.jpg

-   anagram - word play, rearrange letters of a word/phrase to produce a
    new one; use original letters exactly once
-   when two unigram vectors match - it's an anagram
-   eg.: listen - silent

390.cos-sim-illustrated.jpg

-   take input, produces vector, calculate cosine similarity, get score

400.cos-sim-code.png

-   when only unigrams are used, 'listen' and 'silent' match perfectly
-   when also bigrams are used, the similarity goes down to 0.2
    (the "en" bigram is common)

410.cos-sim-modules.jpg

-   Data::CosineSimilarity - Compute the Cosine Similarity
-   Text::Ngram - Ngram analysis of text

420.phonetic-alg.jpg

-   not a fuzzy text matching alg per se

430.pizza.jpg

-   "i'll never be your beast of burden" - guess the song
-   play first 20 sec of "The Rolling Stones - Beast Of Burden"
-   helps to find what sounds alike but is spelled different

440.soundex-code.png

-   soundex() - old popular american english function found in many
    databases

450.phonetic-illustrated.jpg

-   like a hash or digest function

460.billie.jpg

-   soundex example
-   1st letter is retained
-   vowels dropped
-   consonants mapped to digits
-   rest: 0-padded or discarded

470.phonetic-alg.jpg

-   soundex - four-character strings composed of a single letter
    followed by three numbers, American English
-   Metaphone, Double Metaphone, and Metaphone 3 which are suitable for
    use with most English words, not just names;
    are the basis for many popular spell checkers
-   Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex - soundex refinement for surnames of Slavic
    and Germanic origin
-   Kölner Phonetik - soundex for German words
-   NYSIIS - New York State Identification and Intelligence System,
    maps similar phonemes to the same letter; the result is a string
    that can be pronounced by the reader without decoding
-   Caverphone - created to assist in data matching between late 19th
    century and early 20th century electoral rolls, optimized for
    accents present in parts of New Zealand

480.soundex.jpg

-   Text::Soundex - Implementation of the soundex algorithm
-   Text::Metaphone - A modern soundex. Phonetic encoding of words
